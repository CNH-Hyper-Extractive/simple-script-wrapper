=====================

===Overview===

The Simple Script Wrapper (SSW) is a software component developed by the Consortium for Global Research on Water-based Economies (GRoWE) at Kansas State University. It provides a simple way to link models written in scripting languages such as Matlab, Scilab, and Python to Open Modeling Interface (OpenMI) components. To create a linkable script a scientist (1) writes a properties file that describes the model and (2) adds three functions to their model script that are responsible for initializing the model, performing a single time step, and shutting down the model.
